Fix F* compilation errors in ElectromagnetismFiberBundle using auto modeling

Resolved compilation errors by applying automatic modeling techniques:

- Warning 242: Extracted inner let-rec `transport_along_path` to top-level
  function to enable SMT encoding. The inner recursive function was not
  being encoded to the solver, so it was moved to module scope with
  proper termination proof.

- Error 189 (line 235): Added explicit return type annotation `Tot bool`
  to `bianchi_identity` function to resolve type inference issues.

- Error 189 (line 273): Fixed type mismatches by:
  * Changing `spacetime` type from `nat` to `int` to match `direction` parameters
  * Refactoring `covariant_derivative` to use separate `int` parameters instead
    of tuple type (avoiding conflict with `FStar.Mul` multiplication operator)
  * Updated tuple type syntax from `*` to `&` where needed due to `FStar.Mul` import

- Error 19 (termination): Extracted `apply_transforms` to top-level recursive
  function with `decreases params` clause to prove termination.

All functions now properly encoded to SMT solver with correct type annotations
and termination proofs. Module verifies successfully.
